With the purpose of manually writing a simple operating system, the project is designed for sophomores at NJUCS by JYY. Finishing it is valuable for understanding the operating system, even for the computer system, so I chose to rewrite it and understand it more deeply during my graduate.And I will give a series of project notes.
